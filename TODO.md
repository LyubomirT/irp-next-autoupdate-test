- [x] Add a logger

  - It seems like DeepSeek models actually get far less creative with the caching enabled
  - Presumably the caching system is always-on in their web app
  - My idea is to add a cache busting option that forces clean generations
  - This *could* be done in SillyTavern, though, so perhaps it's not necessary here
  - **ANYWAY**: I'll add a simple cache busting option to the API that will add a random number to the beginning of the prompt
  - Something like [Request ID: 1234567890] at the start of the prompt
